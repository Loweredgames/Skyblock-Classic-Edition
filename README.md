# Skyblock Classic Edition

Skyblock is the most famous map in Minecraft. the original has been updated and now supports all future versions of Minecraft.

Story:

Steve/Alex wake up on an unknown island, inside a chest it says...

Feature:

the classic islands have been updated and are now more modern.
added new islands (Small, Normal, Large).
there are some recipes that make some items renew (check the recipes book).
added the data package so you can always create new worlds and automatically install the map for you. (you have to add "generated" if not do not spawn the islands).
the world is infinite (including The Nether).
now you can visit the end and finish the game.
the map includes a piece of the unofficial Slamacow trailer (a mini storyline).
it also contains a hardcore mode. (inside the "datapack" folder in the "Skyblock Classic Edition Hardcore" folder)
compatible with multiplayer.
Multiplayer

if you play with friends you can play multiplayer where you need to go to "Datapacks/Skyblock Classic Edition/data/skyblock/functions/multiplayer.mcfunction" and enable the strings where it says server only.
 

To convert the worlds in the most recent map:

download the map most recent and then take the datapack and add "generated" folder (if not do not spawn the islands),
replace it by deleting the old datapack and adding the new datapack,
and use the command /reload and automatically the function does everything for you.
 

If the world has remained at version 1.0.0:

download the map most recent,
then take the new datapack,
replace it by deleting the old datapack,
then click "legacy" at the beginning and automatically the function does everything for you (ATTENTION: DO NOT ENTER THE COMMAND IF YOU ARE IN 2.0.0 AND LATER. LOOK AT THE FILES IF YOU ARE IN THE CORRET VERSION).

The experimental worlds are worlds still in development and they can have problems, I am not responsible for the problems that may come. visit the bug site here.

 
thanks to the original Skyblock team for creating the most popular Minecraft map.
